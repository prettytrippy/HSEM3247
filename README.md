# HSEM3247

HSEM3247 is a ~~creatively titled~~ rock climbing video game. You play as an alpinist, during a time where odd atmospheric phenomena make the night sky particularly beautiful. Each ascent rewards you with exposure to such phenomena, and the satisfaction of completing the climb. Each climb risks eroding the route, making it impossible to climb again, as well as death, making it impossible for **you** to climb again. How much beauty is worth this kind of risk?

## Installation

From command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prettytrippy/HSEM3247
cd HSEM3247
source venv/bin/activate
python3 game.py
```

Or, you can install a zip file from [this link](https://github.com/prettytrippy/HSEM3247) directly. Then, activate the venv and run ```python3 game.py```.

## Gameplay

Hit the space bar when the hand icon is on the next hold to advance. If you hit the space bar at the wrong time, you'll slip back to the last hold and risk death. Your reward is a pretty cellular automata animation (it's supposed to look like plasma, or clouds, or solar flares).

## Secret Tip

You can instantly reach MAX LEVEL by setting it to 100 in the info.json file.
